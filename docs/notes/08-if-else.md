# Unit 8: Conditional Statement

## Learning Objectives

After going through this unit, students should:

- understand that branching in flowcharts relates to either `if-else` statements or loops;
- be able to identify the three components of an `if-else` statement: the condition, the `true` block, and the `false` block;
- be able to develop an `if-else` statement in C, including, (i) nested `if-else`, (ii) `if` without `else` blocks, and (iii) `else if` blocks;
- be able to model a computational solution with different conditions as a table;
- understand the meaning and the use of the type `void`
- understand the term _string_ and be able to use `cs1010_println_string` to print a string to the screen.
- be aware that in CS1010:
    - curly brackets must not be skipped even if a block contains only a single statement;
	- nested conditional operators are banned.
- be aware of floating-point numbers must not be compared using equality.

## Branching
So far the C programs that we have written have a straightforward _execution path_.  The execution flows from top to bottom in the `main` function, jumping to a function being called (or _callee_), and back to the caller when the function returns.

We have, however, seen a few examples so far where the execution path can _branch_ off to either one of two paths, depending on a condition:

- In the algorithm to compute the $max(L, k)$, we check if $i$ equals $k$, and stop checking if it is true; repeat if it is false.
- In the algorithm to compute the $max(L, k)$, we check if $l_i > m$, and update $m$ only if this is true.  
- In the algorithm to compute the $factorial(n)$, we check if $n$ equals 0, and return 1 if it is true, otherwise, we return $n \times factorial(n-1)$.

The first example above concerns _repeating_ a step.  We will look into this in [Unit 11](11-loop.md).  For now, we will look at the other two examples first.

Let's use the $factorial(n)$ function as an example.  

![factorial](figures/max-flowchart/max-flowchart-pdf-9.png)

In C, the $factorial(n)$ would look like this:
```C title="Calculating Factorial (v1)"
long factorial(long n)
{
  long answer;
  if (n == 0) {
    answer = 1;
  } else {
    answer = n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
  return answer;
}
```

In this example, you see two new C keywords `if` and `else`.  These keywords are used to create _conditional blocks_.  The general syntax is:

```C title="Syntax for if-else Statements"
if (<logical expression>) {
  "true block": statements to be executed if expression evaluates to true
} else {
  "false block": statements to be executed if expression evaluates to false
}
```

The keyword `if` is followed by a _logical expression_ in parentheses.  This is followed by a block of statements (in curly braces `{` and `}`).  If the logical expression is true, then the statements are executed.  Otherwise, they are skipped and the statements following the `else` block are executed instead.  For this reason, the group of statements following `if` is known as a _true block_, and the group of statements following `else` is known as the _false block_.

## Comparison Operator

The logical expression `n == 0` is true if the variable `n` holds the value of `0`.

!!! warn "`==` vs `=`"
    Note that the use of TWO `=` signs.  This is often confused by newbie programmers with a single `=` sign, which is used for assignment.  A common bug is writing

    ```C
      if (n = 0) {
         :
      }
    ```

The `==` is known as a _comparison operator_.  It compares if the expression on the left-hand side has the same value as the expression on the right-hand side.  Other comparison operators include `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to), and `!=` (not equal).

In other words, the variable `answer` will be set to `1` if the parameter `n` equals `0`.
What if `n` is not `0`?  The block that contains Line 5 `answer = 1;` will be skipped, and Line 7 `answer =  n * factorial(n - 1);` will be executed instead.

## Nested Else-If

The example above considers _two_ possible execution paths only.  In some situations, we may need to consider more than two execution paths.  Take the following problem for example.  We are given the numerical score for an assignment, ranging between 0 and 10.  We want to print out the letter grade of the assignment according to the table below:

| Score                       | Letter Grade |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| 8 or higher                 | A            |
| Less than 8 but 5 or higher | B            |
| Less than 5 but 3 or higher | C            |
| Less than 3                 | D            |

!!! tip "Summary Table"
    Building a table that summarizes the different possibilities is a useful tool when planning your solution to solve a computational problem.

Since the `if`-`else` statement only allows branching into two possibilities, we can branch into multiple possibilities by nesting the `if`-`else` statements hierarchically.  We can first break the table down into three tables, each containing only two rows, with one row a negation of the other row.

__Table 1 (A Grade)__

| Score       | Letter Grade |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 8 or higher | A            |
| Less than 8 | See Table 1  |

__Table 2 (B Grade)__

| Score       | Letter Grade |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Less than 8 but 5 or higher | B            |
| Less than 5 | See Table 2  |

__Table 3 (C or D Grade)__

| Score       | Letter Grade |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Less than 5 but 3 or higher | C            |
| Less than 3 | D            |

The tables above can be translated into a flowchart below:

![flowchart](figures/max-flowchart/max-flowchart-pdf-18.png)

which can then be written into the following function with three nested `if`-`else` blocks:

```C title="Function to Print The Letter Grade Given The Score (v1)"
void print_score(double score) // (1)!
{
  if (score >= 8) {
    cs1010_println_string("A"); // (2)!
  } else {
    // Table 1
    if (score >= 5) {
      cs1010_println_string("B");
    } else {
      // Table 2
      if (score >= 3) {
        cs1010_println_string("C");
      } else {
        cs1010_println_string("D");
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1. `void` is a special keyword in C that indicates a "nothing" type.
2. We use a pair of double quotes `"` to mark the beginning and the end of text strings in C.

There are also a couple of "first" in the sample code above:

- You see the keyword `void` for the first time.  `void` is a special type that indicates nothing.  The function `print_score` does not return anything, it accepts an input `score` and prints something to the screen.  As such, we say that the return type of `print_score` is `void`.  A function whose return type is `void` does not need to have a `return` statement.
- You see _strings_ for the first time (`"A"`, etc.).  A _string_ is a sequence of characters.  We use double quotes `"` to mark the beginning and the end of a string and use the CS1010 I/O library function `cs1010_println_string` to print a string to the screen.  We won't cover how to declare a string variable or manipulate a string yet, until after the mid-semester break.  For now, we will use strings in the context of printing output messages to the users.

You can imagine that as the number of possible letter grades increases (NUS has 11), we will have many nested `if`-`else`, and the code gets complicated.  To reduce the number of nesting, we can write `else if` directly, without nesting:

```C title="Using else-if for Multiple Branches (v2)"
void print_score(double score) 
{
  if (score >= 8) {
    cs1010_println_string("A");
  } else if (score >= 5) {
    cs1010_println_string("B");
  } else if (score >= 3) {
    cs1010_println_string("C");
  } else {
    cs1010_println_string("D");
  }
}
```

The above code is easier to read but has the same flow as the one with nested `if`-`else` earlier.

## Skipping `else`

In some algorithms, we don't need to have an else block.

For instance, suppose we have a variable `m`, and we wish to compare it with another variable `x`.  We set `m` to `x` if `x` is the larger of the two, but we do not need to do anything otherwise.   Regardless of whether `m` or `x` is larger, we will print out `m` after the comparison. 

![flowchart](figures/max-flowchart/max-flowchart-pdf-20.png)

We could write it as:

```C title="Code with Empty False Block"
 :
if (m < x) {
  m = x;
} else {
  // do nothing
}
cs1010_println_long(m);
 :
```

The false block is empty, and we could keep our code succinct by removing it altogether.

```C title="Skipping Else"
 :
if (m < x) {
  m = x;
}
cs1010_println_long(m);
 :
```

One, however, needs to be careful with skipping the else block.  

Let's consider another example.  Suppose we have three `long` variables, `x`, `y`, and `max`, and we want to set `max` to the maximum of `x` and `y`.

Consider the following code snippet:

```C title="Bad Code Example: Skipping Else"
if (x > y) {
  max = x;
}
if (x < y) {
  max = y;
}
```

Take a moment to understand the code above, and see if you can figure out what is wrong.

When we think about writing conditionals, we have to _exhaustively reason about what are all the possible scenarios that could occur_.  In this example, we need to think about what are the possible relationships between `x` and `y` when we compare `x` and `y`.  There are three possibilities:

- `x > y`: `x` is larger, and we set `max` to `x`
- `y > x`: `y` is larger, and we set `max` to `y`
- `x == y`: both are equally large, so the maximum can be either `x` or `y`.

In the code above, `max` is not updated if `x == y`!

The following code adds the third case and arbitrarily chooses to set `max` to `y` if both `x` and `y` have the same value.

```C title="Setting max to the Larger of x and y"
if (x > y) {
  max = x;
}
if (x < y) {
  max = y;
}
if (x == y) {
  max = y;
}
```

The code snippet above now correctly sets `max` to the maximum of `x` and `y`.  The code, however, is inefficient since it redundantly compares `x` and `y` three times.  Regardless of whether `x` or `y` is larger, the conditions `x > y`, `x < y`, and `x == y` are always evaluated.  See the flowchart below.

![flowchart](figures/max-flowchart/max-flowchart-pdf-21.png)

To get around this redundant comparison, let's try to simplify the code.  First, since the "true block" for `x < y` and `x == y` are the same, we can combine it into a single comparison `x <= y`.

```C title="Setting max to the Larger of x and y (Simplified)"
if (x > y) {
  max = x;
}
if (x <= y) {
  max = y;
}
```

But, if `x > y` is false, then `x <= y` must be true!  We say that `x > y` and `x <= y` are _negation_ (or opposite) of each other.  So, the check for `x <= y` is redundant -- checking `x > y` is enough to tell us if `x <= y`.  We can re-write the code above succinctly as:

```C title="Setting max to the Larger of x and y (Simplified)"
if (x > y) {
  max = x;
} else {
  max = y;
}
```

So, we should not skip the `else` block in the case above, to begin with.

There are, however, other cases where the `else` block can be skipped.  Consider the code:

```C title="Calculating Factorial (v1)"
long factorial(long n)
{
  long answer;
  if (n == 0) {
    answer = 1;
  } else {
    answer = n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
  return answer;
}
```

Since we do not modify or use the variable `answer` in a meaningful way except as a placeholder to be returned later, we could remove this variable to simplify our code.  We could write the function more succinctly as:

```C title="Calculating Factorial (v2)"
long factorial(long n)
{
  if (n == 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
```

Now that we removed the variable `answer`, we could go one step further, and remove the `else`.

```C title="Calculating Factorial (v3)"
long factorial(long n)
{
  if (n == 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

We can always do this without changing the outcome of the function since Line 6 will be executed only if the condition of Line 3 is false.  If the condition on Line 3 is true, the function will return and Line 6 will be skipped!

In CS1010, we follow this rule: we do not write an `else` after a `return` statement, since it is redundant.

## Conditional Operator

Another way to express a conditional statement in C is to use the ternary conditional operator, which consists of two special characters `?` and `:`.  We use this operator in the format of:

```
condition ? true expression : false expression;
```

If the `condition` evaluates to true, then the `true expression` will be evaluated and returned, otherwise, the `false expression` will be evaluated and returned.

The conditional operator allows us to replace

```C
if (x > y) {
  max = x;
} else {
  max = y;
}
```

with a single line:

```C title="Using Conditional Operator"
max = (x > y) ? x : y;
```

We can nest the conditional operator as well, but it does not necessarily make your code easier to read once you start nesting them up.  For example,
```C
a = (x > y) ? ((y > z) ? y : z) : ((z > x) ? x : z);
```

Nesting of conditional operators is therefore not allowed in CS1010.

In some cases, even without nesting, the conditional operator does not make the code easier to understand.  Take the `factorial` function, for instance,

```C title="Calculating Factorial (v4)"
long factorial(long n)
{
  return n == 0 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

So, CS1010 advises you to use the `? :` operator sparingly and only when you know what you are doing.

## Common Pitfalls with Conditional Statements

### Comparing Real Numbers

Recall that we said [real numbers cannot be represented exactly in computers](04-type.md).  Comparing real numbers, therefore, becomes a little trickier in programming.  The `if` statement

```C
double expected_value = 0.3;
double sum = 0.1 + 0.2;
if (sum == expected_value) {
 :
}
```

would not be evaluated as `true` as expected!

Thus, to compare real numbers, we normally allow some errors in comparisons -- we want the absolute difference between `sum` and `expected_value` to be small enough.

```C
double expected_value = 0.3;
double sum = 0.1 + 0.2;
if (fabs(sum - expected_value) < 0.000001) {
 :
}
```

### Indentation

We use indentation to indicate the nesting of blocks below:

```C title="Function to Print the Letter Grade Given the Score (v1)"
void print_score(double score) // (1)!
{
  if (score >= 8) {
    cs1010_println_string("A"); // (2)!
  } else {
    // Table 1
    if (score >= 5) {
      cs1010_println_string("B");
    } else {
      // Table 2
      if (score >= 3) {
        cs1010_println_string("C");
      } else {
        cs1010_println_string("D");
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Using indentation to denote the nesting of blocks is not required by C's syntax (unlike languages such as Python), but it is a widely accepted, good, programming practice, and is required for CS1010.

The code below compiles perfectly but is not as easy to read by a human as the above.

```C title="Bad Code Example: Bad Indentation"
void print_score(double score)
{
  if (score >= 8) {
    cs1010_println_string("A"); } else { // Table 1
    if (score >= 5) { cs1010_println_string("B");
  } else { // Table 2
if (score >= 3) {
  cs1010_println_string("C");
      } else {
        cs1010_println_string("D");
    } } } }
// Don't write code like this.
```

### Curly Braces

The C standard says that, if the block contains only one statement, we can skip the curly braces `{` and `}`.  In the example above, we can write:

```C title="Bad Code Example: Skipping Braces"
void print_score(double score)
{
  if (score >= 8)
    cs1010_println_string("A");
  else if (score >= 5)
    cs1010_println_string("B");
  else if (score >= 3)
    cs1010_println_string("C");
  else
    cs1010_println_string("D");
}
```

Despite being allowed by the C standard, this is considered a bad practice and should be avoided.  Imagine some time later, you go back to this code, and want to write something extra:

```C title="Bad Code Example: Skipping Braces "
void print_score(double score)
{
  if (score >= 8)
    cs1010_println_string("A");
  else if (score >= 5)
    cs1010_println_string("B");
  else if (score >= 3)
    cs1010_println_string("C");
  else
    cs1010_println_string("You can do better!");
    cs1010_println_string("D");
}
```

What would be printed?

The famous [Apple `goto fail` bug](https://www.wired.com/2014/02/gotofail/) wouldn't have happened in the there is a pair of curly braces added!

Alternatively, if you have code like this:

```C title="Bad Code Example: Skipping Braces"
if (score >= 8)
  if (late_penalty != 0)
      cs1010_println_string("late submission");
else
  cs1010_println_string("you can do better!");
```

It might look like `you can do better!` will be printed if the `score` is less than 8, but actually, `you can do better!` will be printed if the `score` is larger or equal to 8 and there is no late penalty, which is not what is intended.

### Redundant Comparisons

CS1010 insists that students should not make redundant conditional statements when writing `if`-`else` statements.  A condition is redundant if it is always true or always false.  

Take the example below:

```C title="Redundant Comparison of x <= y"
if (x > y) {
  max = x;
}
if (x <= y) {
  max = y;
}
```

Here, we compare both `x > y` and `x <= y`, but since the conditions are the negation of each other, if one is true then the other must be false.   We only need to make one comparison between `x` and `y`.

Another example is the version of `print_score` below:

```C title="Bad Code Example: Redundant Comparisons of score"
void print_score(double score) 
{
  if (score >= 8) {
    cs1010_println_string("A");
  } else if (score < 8) {
    // Table 1
    if (score >= 5) {
      cs1010_println_string("B");
    } else if (score < 5) {
      // Table 2
      if (score >= 3) {
        cs1010_println_string("C");
      } else if (score < 3) {
        cs1010_println_string("D");
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The conditions `score < 8`, `score < 5`, and `score < 3` are always true and are therefore redundant.  

## Problem Sets

### Problem 8.1

Draw the flowcharts for the two code snippets below.  Identify redundant comparisons (if any), in each of the snippets.

(a)
```C
if (x > y) {
  max = x;
} else if (x < y) {
  max = y;
} else if (x == y) {
  max = y;
}
```

(b)
```C
if (x > y) {
  max = x;
} else {
  max = y;
}
```

### Problem 8.2

Suppose we break down the table below in a slightly different way.

| Score                       | Letter Grade |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| 8 or higher                 | A            |
| Less than 8 but 5 or higher | B            |
| Less than 5 but 3 or higher | C            |
| Less than 3                 | D            |

We rewrite the tables into three smaller tables, as follows:

| Score       | Letter Grade |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 5 or higher | See Table X  |
| Less than 5 | See Table Y  |

where Table X (5 or higher) is

| Score       | Letter Grade |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 8 or higher | A            |
| Less than 8 | B            |

and Table Y (less than 5) is

| Score       | Letter Grade |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 3 or higher | C            |
| Less than 3 | D            |

Write the corresponding `if`-`else` statements to print out the letter grade based on the tables above.  Draw the corresponding flowchart.
