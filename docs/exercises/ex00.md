## Question 1: Echo

Write a program `echo` (source file `echo.c`) that reads in an integer and prints that integer to the standard output.

### Sample Runs

```
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./echo
123
123
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./echo
-1
-1
```

The text `ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$` is the command prompt.  Yours will look different, of course.  `echo` is the executable you created.  The next line, `123`, is the input you provide.  Press enter after the input.  `123` is the output printed by `echo`.

## Question 2: Divide

Write a program `divide` (source file `divide.c`) that reads in two integers, $x$ and $y$, and print the value of $x$ divided by $y$.  You can assume that $y$ is never 0.

### Sample Runs

```
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./divide
10 2
5.0000
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./divide
1 2
0.5000
```

## Question 3: Ones

Write a program `ones` (source file `ones.c`) that reads in a positive integer $n$ that is at least 10.  Print two lines to the standard output: the first line contains the last digit of $n$.  The next line contains all the other digits of $n$ excluding the last one. 

The `main` function has been provided in the file `ones-main.c`.  You should not change this file.  Only fill in the body of the function `print_last_digit` and `print_all_but_last_digit` in the file `ones.c`.

### Sample Runs

```
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./ones
10
0
1
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./ones
95324
4
9532
```

## Question 4: BMI

Your body mass index (BMI) can be calculated by your body mass divided by the square of the body height.  BMI is expressed in units of $kg/m^2$. 

Write a program `bmi` (source file `bmi.c`) that reads in two real numbers $h$ and $w$ from the standard input.  $h$ is the height of a person _in centimeters (cm)_, and weight is the weight of the person in kilograms (kg).

Your program must include a function called `compute_bmi` that takes in two parameters, the weight in kilograms (kg), and height _in meters (m)_, and return the corresponding BMI of the given weight and height.

### Sample Runs

```
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./bmi
100.0 50
50.0000
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./bmi
182.9 70.125
20.9626
```

## Question 5: Quadratic

Write a program `quadratic` (source file `quadratic.c`) that reads in three floating point numbers, $a$, $b$, and $c$, that represent the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, and prints its two roots.  Assume that $a \not = 0$ and $b^2 > 4ac$.  Recall that the roots are:

$$
\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Print the root $\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ first on one line,
followed by the other root $\frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ on the next line.

Try and decompose the computation of the roots into smaller functions for reusability.

### Sample Runs

```
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./quadratic
1.0 -2.0 1.0
1.0000
1.0000
ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./quadratic
2.0 -7.0 3.0
3.0000
0.5000
```

## Question 6: Cuboid

A cuboid is a 3D shape with six rectangular faces.  We can specify such a cuboid with three parameters, the width $w$, the length $l$, and the height $h$.

![cuboid](figures/ex00-cuboid/cuboid.png){ width="60%" }

Our task is to calculate (i) the surface area of a cuboid, and (ii) the length of the diagonal of the cuboid (the red dash line in the figure above). 

Complete the task by decomposing the calculations into two functions.  To complete this task, in `cuboid.c`,

- Write a function `hypotenuse_of` to compute the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, given the length of the legs (the sides adjacent to the right angle).
- Write a function `area_of_rectangle` that computes the area of a rectangle given its width and length.

Finally, complete the program `cuboid.c` so that it reads, from the standard input, three positive integers representing the width, length, and height of the cuboid (in that order) and prints, to the standard output, its surface area, followed by the length of its diagonal.

Solve this question by using composing and reusing the two functions above.  You may add additional functions if needed.

Pay attention to the types (`long` or `double`) used in the inputs, calculations, and outputs.  Keep your variable as integer type (`long`) as long as possible.

ooiwt@pe111:~/ex00-ooiwt$ ./cuboid
