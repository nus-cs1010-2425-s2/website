^: Questions 6 - 8 serve as in-class exercises during the lab session in Week 5.

### Efficiency

For `prime` and `pattern`, while we do not require an advanced fast algorithm to check for primality testing, your code should not waste time by doing redundant work.  You can use the `time` command to measure how long it takes to run a command.  E.g.,

```
$ time ./test.sh prime
prime: passed

real    0m3.908s
user    0m3.864s
sys     0m0.083s

$ time ./test.sh pattern
pattern: passed

real    0m0.172s
user    0m0.133s
sys     0m0.059s
```

If you code takes too long to run, it will timeout and fail the test case.

## Question 1: Lemon

A $(l,m,n)$-run (also known as a lemon run) is a sequence of $m$ integers ($m \ge 1$) with a gap of $n$ between one number and the next, starting with $l$, i.e., $\langle l, l+n, l+2n, ..., l+(m-1)n \rangle.$

Write a program called `lemon` that reads in three integers $l$, $m$, and $n$ from the standard input, and prints to the standard outputs, the numbers in the $(l, m, n)$-run, one number per line.

### Sample Runs

ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./lemon

## Question 2: Factor

Given a number $n$, we want to find out how many factors $n$ has, excluding the trivial factor 1 and $n$.

Write a program `factor` that reads, from the standard input, a positive integer $n$, and prints, to the standard output, the number of factors of $n$ between 2 and $n-1$, inclusive.

### Sample Runs

```
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./factor

```


## Question 3: Parity

Write a program `parity`, that reads from standard input a positive integer $n$ and prints to the standard output the following two lines,
```
odd: X
even: Y
```

where `X` represents the number of odd digits in $n$, and `Y` represents the number of even digits in $n$.

The main function is given to you in the file `parity-main.c`.  You should not change this file.  You should write your solution in a file called `parity.c` by replacing the body of the function `print_parity`.

### Sample Runs

```
ooiwt@pe119:~/ex02-albertsutz$ ./parity
123456
odd: 3
even: 3
ooiwt@pe119:~/ex02-albertsutz$ ./parity
111333
odd: 6
even: 0
```

## Question 4: Nine

Write a program that looks for the least significant occurrence of digit 9 in a given number.

Your program, `nine`, should read a positive number from the standard input and print out the position of the least significant occurrence of 9.  The rightmost digit has the position of 1, the second last has the position of 2, etc.  If the number 9 does not appear in the given number, print 0.

Solve this problem in a function called `find_least_significant_9` that takes in a `long` parameter (the input number) and returns a `long` (the position of 9).  Your function should not search through more digits than necessary.

### Sample Runs

```
ooiwt@pe119:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./nine

## Question 5: HDB

ASCII Art refers to the art of drawing with only common letters, numbers, and symbols on our keyboard.  My daughter has discovered that, if we draw rows of `#` symbols together, the output looks like an HDB flat!

Write a program `hdb` that takes in two positive integers $w$ and $h$, and draw $h$ rows of `#` symbols, each row containing $w$ `#`, with no spaces before, in between, and after.

## Question 6: Binary

In this question, you are asked to convert a number represented in binary format (using digits 0 and 1) into decimal format (using digits 0 and 9).

A number in decimal format is represented with base 10.  The last digit (rightmost) corresponds to the unit of 1, the next digit (second last) corresponds to the unit of 10, and so on. So, one can write the decimal number,
for instance, 7146 as 7×1000 + 1×100 + 4×10 + 6×1.

A number represented in binary uses base 2 instead of base 10.  The last digit corresponds to 1. The second last digit corresponds to 2, the third last digit corresponds to 4, and so on. So, the binary number 1101, for instance, corresponds to 1×8 + 1×4 + 1×1 = 13.

Write a program called `binary` that reads in a positive integer consisting of only 0s and 1s from the standard input, treats it as a binary number, and prints the corresponding decimal number to the standard output.

Try to solve this question with two different approaches: (i) recursively and (ii) iteratively with loops.

### Sample Runs

## Question 7: Onigiri

![onigiri](figures/ex02-onigiri.jpg){ align=left }

Onigiri is a Japanese rice ball often formed in a triangular or cylindrical shape and wrapped in nori. 

We are going to draw some triangular onigiri on our screen using #s.

Write a program `onigiri.c` that draws an isosceles triangle using ` ` (white space) and `#`.  The program must read in a positive integer representing the height $h$ of a triangle.  The triangle must have exactly $h$ rows.  Each row must have exactly $2h-1$ characters (including white spaces but excluding a new line).  On each row, the sequence of "#" characters must be centralized, padded by white spaces on both sides.

### Sample Run

```
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./onigiri

```


### Hints

1.  First, find the pattern to draw the triangle.

    On row $k$, how many `#`s should you draw?  How many white spaces should be padded on the left and the right?

2.  Write a function that draws a particular row of the triangle.  Then, call this function repeatedly in a loop.

3.  White spaces are not visible.  To help you debug, you can pipe the output through a Unix tool called `sed`.

```
ooiwt@pe112:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./onigiri | sed 's/ /./g'

## Question 8: Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... Fibonacci numbers often appear in mathematics as well as in nature and have many fascinating properties.

The Fibonacci sequence can be constructed as follows. The first Fibonacci number is 1. The second Fibonacci number is also 1. Subsequently, the $i$-th Fibonacci number is computed as the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers, the $(i-2)$-th, and the $(i-1)$-th.

Write a program called `fibonacci` that reads a positive integer number $n$ from the standard input, and prints the $n$-th Fibonacci number to the standard output. 

Try to solve this question with two different approaches: (i) recursively and (ii) iteratively with loops.  

Note that when $n$ is large, your recursive approach may take a long time to run, or even crash with the error `Segmentation fault (core dumped)`.  This is expected.

## Question 9: Collatz

The Collatz Conjecture was introduced by the mathematician [Lothar Collatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothar_Collatz) in 1937. Also known as the $3n+1$ conjecture, the problem can be stated very simply but yet no one can prove that it is true or false. The conjecture states the following:

Consider the following operation on a positive integer $n$: if $n$ is even, divide it by two; otherwise, triple it and add one. Suppose we form a sequence of numbers by performing this operation repeatedly, beginning with any positive integer, then this process will eventually reach the number 1, for any initial positive integer $n$.

For instance, if $n$ = 10, then we have the sequence

10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

The smallest number of steps taken by this process for $n$ to reach 1 is called the _total stopping time_. In the example above, the total stopping time for 10 is 6.

Write a program `collatz.c` that reads in two positive integers $m$ and $n$ from the standard input ($m \le n$) and finds out, among the numbers between $m$ {--to--} {++and++} $n$, inclusive, which one has the largest total stopping time. If two numbers have the same total stopping time, we break ties by choosing the larger number as the answer.

Your program should print to the standard output, the largest total stopping time, followed by the corresponding number, in two different lines.

### Sample Runs

## Question 10: Rectangle

Write a program called rectangle that reads two positive integers from the standard input, corresponding to the width and the height of the rectangle. The width and height must be at least 2. Draw a rectangle on the screen using the special ASCII characters "╔" "╗" "╝" "╚" "═" "║", which corresponds to the top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left, top/bottom edge, and left/right edge of the rectangle respectively. Strings consisting of these special characters have been given to you in `rectangle.c`, and we have defined them as constants. For instance, "╔" is called `TOP_LEFT`, and to print this out, you can write 
``` 
cs1010_print_string(TOP_LEFT);
```

### Sample Runs

```
ooiwt@pe113:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./rectangle

```

## Question 11: Prime

Write a program called `prime` that reads a positive integer $n$ ($n \ge 2$) from the standard input and prints the largest prime smaller or equal to $n$.

Recall that a prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Your program must not make unnecessary checks or do repetitive work.  In particular, once you find the evidence that a number is not a prime, there is no need to continue checking.

Your program must contain a boolean function `is_prime` that checks if a given number is prime.  You should call this function in a loop to solve this problem.

`prime` should not take more than 5 seconds on CS1010 PE hosts to pass each of the provided test cases.

### Sample Runs

## Question 12: Pattern

Even though the sequence of prime numbers appears to be random, mathematicians have found some intriguing patterns related to prime numbers. In this question, you are asked to write a program to draw a variation of the "Parallax Compression" pattern discovered by a software engineer, Shaun Gilchrist.

The pattern visualizes the distribution of prime numbers in a triangle, in the following way. The inputs given are an interval $m$ ($m \ge 1$) and the height of the triangle $h$.

The triangle has $h$ rows. The first row of the triangle has one cell, the second row has three cells, the third row has five, etc. The cells are centrally aligned so that visually they form an equilateral triangle. We call the left-most cell of each row the leading cell.

Each cell in the triangle contains $m$ integers. The first cell in the first row contains the numbers 1, 2, ..., $m$. The leading cell of the next row, Row 2, contains $m$ numbers between $m + 1$ and $3m$, with an increment of 2: i.e., $m + 1$, $m + 3$, $m + 5$, .., $m + (2m - 1)$. The leading cell of the next row, Row 3, contains the numbers $3m + 1$ and $6m$, with an increment of 3: i.e., $3m + 1$, $3m + 4$, $3m + 7$,..  $3m+(3m−2)$,
etc.

!!! tips "Lemon Run"
    The leading cell of the rows corresponds to lemon runs for $(1, m, 1)$, $(m+1, m, 2)$, $(3m+1, m, 3)$, etc. 

For instance, if $m$ is 5, the leading cells of the first three rows contain the numbers

- {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},
- {6, 8, 10, 12, 14},
- {16, 19, 22, 25, 28},

respectively.

The rest of the cells in each row contains $m$ numbers where each is one more than a number contained in the cell on its left. So, in Row 2, the numbers in the three cells are

- {6, 8, 10, 12, 14},
- {7, 9, 11, 13, 15}, and
- {8, 10, 12, 14, 16}.

In Row 3, the cells contain

- {16, 19, 22, 25, 28},
- {17, 20, 23, 26, 29},
- {18, 21, 24, 27, 30},
- {19, 22, 25, 28, 31}, and
- {20, 23, 26, 29, 32}.

Now, to visualize the distribution of primes, we do the following, for each cell of the triangle that contains at least one prime, we print `#` to the standard output at the corresponding position. Otherwise, we print `.`.


For example, in Row 3,

- Cell 1: {16, 19, 22, 25, 28}, we print `#` since 19 is prime
- Cell 2: {17, 20, 23, 26, 29}, we print `#` since 23 is prime
- Cell 3: {18, 21, 24, 27, 30}, we print `.` since there is no prime
- Cell 4: {19, 22, 25, 28, 31}, we print `#` since 19 is prime
- Cell 5: {20, 23, 26, 29, 32}, we print `#` sine 23 is prime

So Row 3 will be printed as `##.##` (leading and trailing white spaces are not shown).

Your output must contain exactly $h$ rows, each row exactly $2h−1$ characters (including the white spaces but excluding the newline). Note that in the sample runs below, the white spaces are not visible.

### Example

```
ooiwt@pe114:~/ex02-ooiwt$ ./pattern
2 4
   #   
  #.#  
 ##.## 
#.#.#.#
```

To understand the output, consider the cells below:

![pixel](figures/ex02-pattern/pixels-1.png)

Now, consider the two numbers contained in each cell, in the four rows:

- Row 1: {1,2}
- Row 2: {3,5} {4,6} {5,7}
- Row 3: {7,10} {8,11} {9,12} {10,13} {11,14}
- Row 4: {13,17} {14,18} {15,19} {16,20} {17,21} {18,22} {19,23}

![pixel](figures/ex02-pattern/pixels-2.png)

Now, we check whether the numbers contained in each cell have at least one prime, and replace them with either `#` or `.`.

### Hints

As always, solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller problems.

In addition to drawing triangles and checking if a number is prime, you might find the following sub-problems useful:

- Find the first number of each leading cell of each row, given the row number and the interval $m$.

- Given the row, the col, and the interval $m$, does the cell contain a prime?

`pattern` should take less than a second to pass all the given test cases.
